<p>In the First Folio, the plays of William Shakespeare were grouped into three
   categories: comedies, histories, and tragedies. The histories—along with those
    of contemporary Renaissance playwrights—help define the genre of history plays.
    [1] The Shakespearean histories are biographies of English kings of the previous
     four centuries and include the outliers King John, Edward III and Henry VIII
      as well as a continuous sequence of eight plays covering the Wars of the Roses.
       These last are considered to have been composed in two cycles.
       The so-called first tetralogy, apparently written in the early 1590s, deals
        with the later part of the struggle and includes Henry VI,
         Parts I, II & III and Richard III. The second tetralogy, finished in 1599
          and including Richard II, Henry IV, Parts I & II and Henry V, is frequently
           called the Henriad after its protagonist Prince Hal, the future Henry V.

The folio's classifications are not unproblematic. Besides proposing other categories
 such as romances and problem plays, many modern studies treat the histories
 together with those tragedies that feature historical characters.
  These include Macbeth, set in the mid-11th century during the reigns of
   Duncan I of Scotland and Edward the Confessor and the legendary King Lear
    and also the Roman plays Coriolanus, Julius Caesar, and Antony and Cleopatra.</p>
